# KESACCO: Keen Event Simulation and Analysis for CTA Cluster Observations

This repository contains a software dedicated to the simulation of CTA event files 
corresponding to the observation of galaxy clusters. The event files can then be analyzed 
to produce CTA analysis results.
                                                            
- clustpipe.py : 
	Main code that defines the class ClusterPipe.
    
- clustpipe_common.py : 
  Subclass that defines common tools.
   
- clustpipe_sim.py : 
  Subclass that deal with event simulation.
        
- clustpipe_ana.py : 
  Subclass that deal with observation analysis.
    
- clustpipe_ana_plot.py : 
  Sub-modules dedicated to run automatic plots related to analysis.

- clustpipe_title.py : 
	Title for the software.

- Tools :
  Repository that gather several useful libraries and run ctools scripts.
  It also contain the compact source, background, and observation setup 
  classes.

- notebook :
	Repository where to find Jupyter notebook used for development/example.
